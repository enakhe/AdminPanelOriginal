## Project Description
>  The User and Role Management System project is a critical undertaking for organizations seeking to streamline user access control and enhance security. This comprehensive solution will empower administrators to efficiently manage user accounts and roles, enabling them to assign and revoke permissions based on well-defined roles. By implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and robust authentication mechanisms, the system will bolster data security and ensure that users have the appropriate access to resources.

> The project's objectives include simplifying user onboarding and offboarding processes, providing audit trails for monitoring user activities, and supporting scalability to adapt to evolving business needs.
